## Why do you help people violate copyright? ##

get-flash-videos is a tool, like any tool it can be misused.
[Time shifting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_shifting) has been considered
fair use for many years and using get-flash-videos to download a video for
later viewing is much the same.

This leaves it up to the user to make sure they delete the files when it is appropriate.
I believe this is the best approach -- technological measures such as DRM are
not the way forward, if someone wants to make a copy of a video they **will**
find a way.

If you still think get-flash-videos shouldn't exist then how far should it be
taken? Should programming languages that
[make it possible](http://www.catonmat.net/projects/youtube-downloaders/) to
write a YouTube downloader be banned?
